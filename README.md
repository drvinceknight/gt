# Game Theory

Class site for a third year Game Theory course taught at Cardiff University.

Official attributes:

- Level 6 UG Degree Module
- Spring Semester
- 10 Credits

# Outline description of course

This module introduces students to the mathematical study of multiple
interactive agent decision making. This is an introduction to Game Theory using
programming through notions such as Nash Equilibria and Evolutionary Game
Theory. Students will learn Game Theory in an active way through role playing
and student-led activities.

# Upon completion of this course a student should be able to

- represent games in both Extensive Form and Normal Form.
- understand concepts linked to mixed strategies.
- identify best responses.
- compute dominant strategies.
- define and compute Nash Equilibria (both manually and using software).
- model emergence of cooperation (both manually and using software).
- understand concepts of Evolutionary Game Theory
- compute evolutionary Stable Strategies (both manually and using software).
- model finite population evolutionary games (both manually and using software).

# Syllabus content
