# Group research project (25%)

Due date: end of the Autumn Semester.

Carry out a group research project using Game Theory for a chosen topic of your
choice.

The choice of topic is yours, two potential general areas of investigation:

- Prove and illustrate a theorem from the notes (or otherwise);
- Model a real world scenario using game theory.

You are able to use code to tackle the numerical computations to allow
you to delve further in to the investigation you choose.

You will evidence your work with 2 mediums:

1. A 2 page paper
2. A 15 minute recorded presentation

Your final submission should include the following **3** files:

1. A `main.pdf` file: the pdf file for a 2 page paper.
2. A `presentation.mp4` (or similar file format): the video recording of [your 15 minute presentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/presenting-mathematics.html)
3. A `contribution.md` file: a file describing the contributions of every member of your group.
