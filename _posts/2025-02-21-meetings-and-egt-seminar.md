On Friday did two things: we discussed meetings and I gave a seminar on
evolutionary game theory.

You can see recordings [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=69f84840-adc0-47b4-899d-b2860118b97c).

During the first hour we discussed meetings. The purpose of this is not necessarily to dictate a particular way of meeting but to give you things to consider
You can find a link to a number of principles
on meetings here: [{{site.baseurl}}/topics/meetings.html]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/meetings.html)

After this I gave a seminar on Evolutionary Game Theory. I specifically covered
the replicator dynamics equation using the two thirds of the average game we
played at the start of this module.

- You can find the paper I put up at the end of class [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/examples/the-evolution-of-the-two-thirds-of-the-average-game/paper/main.pdf)

During class someone asked for my LaTeX notes which you can find [here](https://vknight.org/tex/).
