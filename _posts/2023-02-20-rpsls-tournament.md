In Friday's class I took a brief poll about how things were going for students
in the class and then we all played rock paper scissors lizard spock
tournaments.

A recording of the class is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=583acc30-236d-4499-9b2d-afa700c681a8).

### Class temperature check

At the start of class I asked you to rate from 0 to 10 the following aspects of
the class:

1. Pace (0 slow, 10 fast)
2. Fun (0 boring, 10 good)
3. Individual coursework (0 worried, 10 OK)
4. Group coursework (0 worried, 10 good)
5. Content/resources (0 bad, 10 good)
6. Class time (0 bad, 10 good)

39 people responded and the results can be seen here [share.cleanshot.com/XZrFhT0x](https://share.cleanshot.com/XZrFhT0x):

1. Pace got a score of 5.4 out of 10.
2. Fun got a score of 8.2 out of 10.
3. Individual coursework got a score of 4.7/10.
4. Group coursework got a score of 3.7/10.
5. Content/resources got a score of 7.1/10.
6. Class time got a score of 7.4.

Overall I think this looks about right. I understand the worry about the
assessment. For the individual work we will spend time preparing for it (I
promise). For the group coursework please do approach me to discuss ideas.

### A rock paper scissors lizard tournament

After discussing how the class was going, I invited you to play a rock paper
scissors lizard tournament.

The first time I heard of this game (a variation of rock paper scissors) was in
an episode of the Big Bang Theory. You can find a clip of it here:
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/x5Q6-wMx-K8) and a summary of the rules are available
[here](https://github.com/drvinceknight/gt/blob/main/do/static/rpsls/main.pdf).

After everyone played their tournaments (a knock out with a final), we had a
discussion about how to win. A number of suggestions came up including:

- Convincing your opponents you were a weak player prior to playing. (What makes
  a strong player is the question at hand!)
- Believing your opponents might play more or less of a particular strategy and
  choosing accordingly. Specifically I had mentioned prior to the start of play
  that over the years of doing this, I have noticed that not everyone seems
  capable of doing the "Spock" symbol. Rafa brought this up and said he had
  played based on this **BUT** it seems that this year everyone was able to do
  it.
- Being unpredictable. The practical implication of this: make the actions of
  your opponent irrelevant.

Before finishing up, I briefly showed how the game could be represented
mathematically:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1\\\\\\
1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1\\\\\\
-1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1\\\\\\
-1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\\\\\
1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 0\\\\\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
