In class today I showed you a first draft of the paper which we looked at
critically to discuss

You can find a recording of the class here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2ce53e1e-4109-412a-bab2-b15500a55d8b](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2ce53e1e-4109-412a-bab2-b15500a55d8b)

We discussed the paper at length and you can find some of our discussion
captured in the board I used
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2023-2024/boards/the-evolution-of-the-two-thirds-of-the-average-game/main.pdf).

Some of the main points discussed were:

- Consistency of spelling and/or grammar.
- Some areas where mathematics makes the text less clear and some areas where
  mathematics helps with clarity.
- Moving some aspects from the introduction to presentation where more depth
  could be given.
- Consider the color of the graphics to ensure inclusive reading.
- Add some details about the graphics to ensure they're clear.
- Adding more depth to the description of the graphics.

After this, we put together
