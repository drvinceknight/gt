In today's class I went over the notes on repeated games, gave an overview of
tools available in Python for the game theory we have covered so far and then
spoke about group work and meetings.

You can see recordings [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=85d54b61-dc1f-49e7-83db-b37401084a4b).

I started by going over the notes on repeated games and I mentioned this really
[impressive web game](https://ncase.me/trust/) that is essentially the same ideas.

After that I gave a quick overview of using Python. Almost everything I
mentioned in class can be found in the [Python for Mathematics book](https://vknight.org/pfm/cover.html):
specifically this chapter: [Installing and using Jupyter notebooks](https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/how/main.html).

If you would like a review/introduction to basic programming within Python these
two chapters might be worth a read:

- [Variables, conditionals and loops](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/01-variables-conditionals-loops/introduction/main.html)
- [Functions and data structures](https://vknight.org/pfm/building-tools/02-functions-and-data-structures/introduction/main.html)

I showed how you can use two python
libraries [Nashpy](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Axelrod](https://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to do a lot of the calculations
relevant to what we have seen so far. **There are also specific examples of all
of this at the end of every chapter in the game theory notes.**

You can find the notebook I used [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-2026/nbs/speed-run-of-python.ipynb).

After all that we spoke about group work and meetings.
The purpose of this was not necessarily to dictate a particular way of meeting but to give you things to consider
You can find a link to a number of principles
on meetings [here]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/meetings.html).
