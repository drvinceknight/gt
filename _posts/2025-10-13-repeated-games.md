In class today we played a Prisoner's Dilemma tournament.

You can find a recording of the session [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=89328fe4-decd-4d92-b8b0-b37000b5da7d).

We watched an episode of a game show that Peter correctly realised was an
example of a Prisoner's Dilemma. After this we played an **Iterated** Prisoners
Dilemma tournament.

You can see the results here:

With the few minutes we had left I briefly spoke about how a repeated game is a
particular type of an Extensive Form Game so that a strategy is now a mapping
from history of play to actions available.

During the game, Lucas at one point declared: "We will cooperate until you defect and then we
will defect forever". This is exactly what a strategy is from a Mathematical
point of view.

I mentioned [Robert Axelrod's Tournaments](https://vknight.org/gtb/main-6/#sec-axelrods-tournaments) which are a widely cited body of
work that is essentially akin to the tournament we played in class today (on a bigger scale).

On Friday we will spend a bit more time looking at some of the theory in the
notes.
