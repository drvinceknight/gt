In class today I gave a demonstration of a presentation to go with the paper I
that you can find [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/examples/not-reproducing-axelrods-first-tournament/paper/main.pdf).

You can find a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5180e959-f69a-4fc1-aac9-b39a00a55a20)

We finished the class by discussing my notes on principles for presentation: [https://vknight.org/pop/](https://vknight.org/pop/).

One group from previous years put their presentation on 
YouTube and you can find it [here](https://youtu.be/syt0b0GI2wA?si=_A7LOJMr0HDU3TUm).
