Welcome to you if you are thinking of doing MA3604 (Game Theory) this year.

This is a brief message before our first class.

All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
[vknight.org/gt/](https://vknight.org/gt/).

During the class I will use a virtual whiteboard, if you want to you can
access the whiteboard on your own device here: [microsoft whiteboard link](https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:wb:/g/personal/knightva_cardiff_ac_uk/ETDexlIXeMVAm5eiqkJ1rPYBdRvHll8io8U7WMlgx-KS0w?e=06TWE1)

I will be using the School discord server to duplicate class communication.
If you have not joined the School discord server and would like to please check
your emails where you will find a duplicate version of this message with an
email invitation.

I realise that some of you are no doubt still deciding whether or not you
will choose the Game Theory this Semester. During our first class
I will hopefully answer any questions you have but please don't hesitate to
use the chat if there's anything you'd like to know as you choose your
modules.

One important consideration you might want to take in to account is that
**I am going to be away from Cardiff from Week 5 (starting 26th of February) until Easter**.

This does imply some changes to the timetable for the first four weeks of the
Semester. Do check your timetable carefully:

- Week 1:
  - Tuesday 30th of January at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 30th of January at 1710 in Main 1.122 (Small Chemistry LT).
  - Friday 2nd of February at 1110 in Tower 0.01.
- Week 2:
  - Monday 5th of February at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 6th of February at 1110 in Abacws 0.01.
  - Friday 9th of February at 1110 in Tower 0.01.
- Week 3:
  - Tuesday 13th of February at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 13th of February at 1710 in Main 1.122 (Small Chemistry LT).
  - Friday 16th of February at 1110 in Abacws 0.01.
- Week 4:
  - Monday 19th of February at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 20th of February at 1110 in Abacws 0.01.
  - Friday 23rd of February at 1110 in Tower 0.01.

The schedule you can see [here]({{site.baseurl}}/) includes
an expected schedule.

I will be scheduling a virtual support session during my time away from Cardiff
and will be available to meet virtually if I can be helpful.
Thanks :)
