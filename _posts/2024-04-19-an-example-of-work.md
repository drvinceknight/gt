In class today I showed an example of research that could have been a topic
chosen by one of your groups. Looking at the two thirds of the average game from
an evolutionary game theoretic point of view.

You can find a recording of the class here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d95cc0bd-30b6-4912-be8c-b15200c67221](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d95cc0bd-30b6-4912-be8c-b15200c67221)

You can find the notebook I used
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/examples/the-evolution-of-the-two-thirds-of-the-average-game/static/main.ipynb).

After this, as a class we discussed what pieces of the work would be better
suited to the paper or the presentation.

You can find a copy of the board I used [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2023-2024/boards/the-evolution-of-the-two-thirds-of-the-average-game/main.pdf).

The main conclusion was:

**The paper should contain**:

- Description of the game.
- Theory: to include background of replicator dynamics and the fitness function
  used for the two thirds of the average game model.
- Relevant other work (if any).
- The results.

**The presentation should contain**:

- Description of the game.
- Motivation (to include the historical play of the game).
- Some discussion of the limitations of the model.
- Validation and demonstration of the code.
- The results.
