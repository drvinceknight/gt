A huge apology for rushing and overrunning today. I know better and will make
sure I don't do that again.

A recording of the class is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bacbeea1-30f0-4158-acd5-b26d01089628).

We spoke about the general structure of the class and you can find that
information here: [https://vknight.org/gt/topics/about-the-course.html](https://vknight.org/gt/topics/about-the-course.html).

After all this, we discussed what a game is (and I really appreciated the
conversation we had here):

- A set of players
- A set of actions available to each player
- The outcomes of what each player can do.

Then we played the two thirds of the average game.

Here are how everyone played:

- First game: the average was 36.6.
- Second game: the average was 31.8.

Because I rushed this we did not have time to have much of a discussion. We will
talk about this a bit more on Friday, including a question someone who guessed
100 asked at the end:

> Is playing 100 to spoil the game a genuine thing?

That's my rephrasing (so I apologise if I'm not quite repeating your words
correctly!) **but** I will address this question a bit more on Friday.

Another person asked at the end of class:

> "When should I get started on my coursework?"

My answer is essentially: you can start thinking about possible projects already
but I'm aware you don't have much of a definition of game theory yet. So I'd
expect students to be able to come up with project ideas to discuss with me
sometime towards the end of week 2 :)
