I have marked the group coursework and thank you all for your hard work. In
this post I will give a brief summary of the performance.

Here is a statistical summary:

```
         Mark
count    101.000
mean      70.465
std        7.076
min       54.000
25%       66.000
50%       70.000
75%       75.000
max       84.000
```

You can see the distribution of marks here:

I was really impressed by a lot of the work, some of this work has been
throughout the Semester through lengthy discussions with you that I enjoyed but
there was also some work that I hadn't spoken much with you and really impressed
me.

There were a number of presentations that made me laugh (in a good way!) and
also made me think as some of you tackled specific problems I had not thought
about before.

If you're interested you can find a list of all the past projects at
[the assessment page]({{site.baseurl}}/assessment/).

I believe I have written detailed feedback on each of your projects but again: I
welcome any conversation you would like to have so please get in touch with me.

Thanks again for all the effort you put into this assessment. For those of you
graduating I wish you all the best.
