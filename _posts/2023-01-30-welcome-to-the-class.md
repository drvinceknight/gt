Welcome to you if you are thinking of doing MA3604 (Game Theory) this year.

This is a brief message before our first class.

All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
https://vknight.org/gt/.

During the class I will use a virtual whiteboard, if you want to you can
access the whiteboard on your own device here: [microsoft whiteboard link](https://cf-my.sharepoint.com/:wb:/g/personal/knightva_cardiff_ac_uk/ETDexlIXeMVAm5eiqkJ1rPYBdRvHll8io8U7WMlgx-KS0w?e=06TWE1)

I will be using the School discord server to duplicate class communication.
If you have not joined the School discord server and would like to please check
your emails where you will find a duplicate version of this message with an
email invitation.

I realise that some of you are no doubt still deciding whether or not you
will choose the Game Theory this Semester. During our first class 
I will hopefully answer any questions you have but please don't hesitate to
use the chat if there's anything you'd like to know as you choose your
modules.

Thanks :)
