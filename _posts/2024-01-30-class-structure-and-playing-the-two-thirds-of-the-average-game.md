Thanks all today for a fun class!

A recording of the classes are available:

- The morning one here [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e971595-f62a-4f2a-8978-b10200c662de](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7e971595-f62a-4f2a-8978-b10200c662de)
- The evening one here [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b6f602e5-eeb9-40e5-90e4-b10300a5d119](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b6f602e5-eeb9-40e5-90e4-b10300a5d119)

In the morning class we spoke about the general structure of the class and you can find that
information here: [https://vknight.org/gt/topics/about-the-course.html](https://vknight.org/gt/topics/about-the-course.html).

In the evening we spoke again briefly about structure and kindness and I also
mentioned how you can inform me of your groups. Thank you to the student who
came up to me at the end of class to let me know that I needed to create groups
on learning central. I believe this is now down so:

ACTION REQUIRED:

If you do not have a group by the end of Sunday the 11 of February I will
create a group for you.

Add your group members to a group on learning central. I believe it's easy to
find and do but let me know if you cannot find it and/or if I have not set
things up right.

This is my first time using learning central for this so please bare ðŸ§¸ with me :)

After all this, we played the two thirds of the average game.

Here are how everyone played:

I really enjoyed the discussion we had about this. It's the first time someone
brought up the possibility of a coalition which is actually an entire area of
game theory in itself.

I ended the class by briefly describing the 3 things that make up a "Normal Form
Game":

1. Players (you were all the players in the game today)
2. Actions (your available actions were to choose an integer from 0 to 100)
3. Outcomes (the winners were those who guessed closest to 2 / 3rds of the
   average guess).

You can read more about this at the relevant chapter of the course text: [https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/text-book/normal-form-games.html](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/text-book/normal-form-games.html)

You can find links to videos of me lecturing that chapter here: [http://vknight.org/gt/topics/normal-form-games.html](http://vknight.org/gt/topics/normal-form-games.html).

At the end of class Ben came up to me and asked about any further good resources for Game
Theory. Here's a few:

- William Spaniel's YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/@Gametheory101](https://www.youtube.com/@Gametheory101) He
  is a political scientist that doesn't go in to much of the mathematics but does
  look at a lot of contemporary issues through a game theoretic lense.
- Veritasium (an amazing YouTube channel in its own right): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM)
  did a great video recently on the game theory of cooperation (Which we will
  see here: [Prisoners Dilemma]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/prisoners-dilemma.html)
- There is a cool web application / interactive game thing that goes quite well
  with that here: [https://ncase.me/trust/](https://ncase.me/trust/).
- You can find a number of articles but also some good text books here: [https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discussion/bibliography.html](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discussion/bibliography.html)
  Some of these are available in the library.
