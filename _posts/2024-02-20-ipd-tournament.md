In class ran an iterated prisoners dilemma tournament.

You can see a recording of this here: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f55bd298-4d8a-4973-9361-b11700c6837f](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f55bd298-4d8a-4973-9361-b11700c6837f).

Thanks to you all for participating and making this good fun.

After the tournament (congratulations to **Mathletico Madrid**) we briefly
talked about Axelrod's tournaments which have spurned a large amount of research
on the emergence of cooperation.
