In class today we discussed the individual coursework. I did my best to take all
questions and ensure everyone understood what each question is asking for.

You can see a recording of this here:
[cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1ade9747-5728-4e73-99fc-afc700a56b0e](cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1ade9747-5728-4e73-99fc-afc700a56b0e)

Some of the recurring points:

- If a question is asking for a generator then do not empty it (by using `list()`)
  or step through an element of it (by using `next()`). This will result in the
  generator yielding less things than expected.
- When finding the strategy spaces for a repeated game the code shown in "Using
  Python to study Repeated Game with Nashpy -

  is all you need (with an understanding of the theory). The
  rows and columns of the transpose of a matrix correspond to the columns and
  rows of the original matrix. So a game defined by \\((A, B)\\) corresponds to a
  game defined by \\((B^T, A^T)\\) with the row and column players swapped.
- Question 3-a is asking for a single pair of values (there are many possible).
- For replicator dynamics I'd encourage you all to ensure you have a strong
  understanding of the theory.
