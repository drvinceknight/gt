In class today we look at the [example paper](https://vknight.org/gt/assets/examples/the-evolution-of-the-two-thirds-of-the-average-game/paper/main.pdf)
as well as the marking criteria.
**Marking the paper alone is not a good exercise as the entire project also
requires the presentation which we will look at next week.**

You can find a recording of the class [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=34a30ee6-fb06-4c7b-9c94-b39300a556b2).

Below is a summary of my recollection of our conversation:

- The paper should:
    - Say what you have done.
    - Say how you did it.
    - Say what you found.
    - Say why (answer "so what?").
- We spoke about whether or not to use visualisation in a paper. Without this
being a rule I'd suggest it is a good idea when appropriate.
- We spoke about the need to include reference (in the 2 pages).
- We spoke about code and where to include it.
- We spoke about levels of depth (and how specifically the example paper had
little depth).

I asked you as a class to mark the project, based on the paper alone: you came
to an average of about 61/100.

I threw it in to Chat GPT and it gave it a mark of 52/100.

We will come to the mark that I feel it warrants but only after discussing the
presentation.
