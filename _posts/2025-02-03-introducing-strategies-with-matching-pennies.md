Today we mainly talked about what a strategy was: defining it as a way of
picking actions.
A recording of this class is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4fa90059-c8d7-495f-a79e-b274010894dd)

We did this by pairing up and playing two different games:

1. The traditional [matching
   pennies](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/text-book/normal-form-games.html#matching-pennies)
   game defined by the two payoff matrices: \\(A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1\\\\-1 &
   1\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(A=-B\\).
2. The modification of matching
   pennies which is the game defined by the two payoff matrices: \\(A=\begin{pmatrix}2 & -2\\\\-1 &
   1\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(A=-B\\).

We mainly spoke about what strategies we were playing:

- Some flipped a coin which corresponds to \\(\sigma=(1/2, 1/2)\\). We discussed how this did not necessarily make sense in
  the second game.
- Some tried to create a sequence of plays that manipulated their opponent.

I finished early (because I'm an idiot -- and looking at past years' class logs
this seems to be a class where I make this mistake...) so I did not talk much
about the formal definitions. We will start with that on Friday.

**Reminder**: don't forget to form groups and keep an eye on the individual
quizzes. All of this you should be able to do on learning central.
