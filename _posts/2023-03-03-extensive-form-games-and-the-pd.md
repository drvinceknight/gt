In class this week we went over Extensive Form Games and The Prisoners Dilemma.
Extensive Form Games allow us to model more general strategic interactions where
players do not necessarily make decisions with the same amount of information.
The Prisoners Dilemma is a particular game that when repeated allows to be a
model for reputation.

A recording of the class on Extensive Form Games is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0147d6c9-9a05-43aa-815e-afb200bc1381).

A recording of the class on the Prisoners Dilemma is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7c446e03-1458-4ea0-9cdb-afb500c66bf8).

Note that we did not specifically discuss the linking chapter between Extensive
Form Games and The Prisoners Dilemma which is the discussion of [Repeated
Games](https://vknight.org/gt/topics/repeated-games.html) more generically.
Indeed, the Prisoners Dilemma is one particular example of a repeated game which
is heavily studied.

Here are two notebooks that I briefly showed in class:

- [A short notebook finding the Nash equilibria of the Centipede Game (when
  converted to a Normal Form game)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-2023/nbs/2023-02-28-gt.ipynb)
- [Reproducing Robert Axelrod's first tournament]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-2023/nbs/2023-03-03-gt.ipynb)

Apologies that this post is shorter than usual (it's really late and it's been a
very busy week) -- I'll happily write more next week if I can help clarify or
give more structure to anything.
