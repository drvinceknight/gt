I have marked the group coursework and thank you all for your hard work. In
this post I will give a brief summary of the performance.

Here is a statistical summary:

```
            marks
count  106.000000
mean    73.509434
std     12.449705
min      0.000000
25%     66.250000
50%     76.000000
75%     80.000000
max     95.000000
```

You can see the distribution of marks here:

Overall, this cohort produced a strong and diverse set of projects, with a mean
mark of 73.5 and a median of 76 reflecting a high general standard of work. Many
projects demonstrated clear understanding of core game-theoretic ideas, and a
substantial number went beyond basic applications to explore evolutionary
dynamics, repeated games, learning, and simulation in creative and engaging
ways. The upper quartile of marks (80+) contained several genuinely impressive
pieces of work, showing depth of analysis, originality, and excellent
integration of theory, computation, and interpretation.

Across the cohort, the most successful projects shared a few common features: a
clearly stated mathematical model, well-explained simulations, and results that
were carefully interpreted rather than simply presented. Strong projects also
showed awareness of the distinction between static and dynamic solution
concepts, and used computational tools to extend insight rather than replace
explanation. Presentations were often a strength, with many students
communicating complex ideas clearly and confidently, even when the written paper
was more limited.

The main areas for improvement were also consistent across projects. A number of
submissions lacked sufficient detail about what was actually done, making
results difficult to interpret or reproduce. In some cases, modelling choices
were not clearly justified, or game-theoretic concepts were invoked without
being formally defined or correctly applied. Several projects would have
benefited from fewer ideas executed more carefully, clearer visualisation of
results, and tighter alignment with the methods taught in the course. Overall,
this was a very strong cohort, and the distribution of marks reflects both the
high quality of the best work and the clear learning progress made across the
group.

I will no longer have a research project component in this course in future
years and feel that this was a really nice set of projects to end on. Thank you
for your hard work.

If you're interested you can find a list of all the past projects at
[the assessment page]({{site.baseurl}}/assessment/).

I believe I have written detailed feedback on each of your projects but again: I
welcome any conversation you would like to have so please get in touch with me.

Thanks again for all the effort you put into this assessment. For those of you
graduating I wish you all the best.
