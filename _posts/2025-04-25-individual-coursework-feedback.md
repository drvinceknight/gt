I have marked the individual coursework and thank you all for your hard work. In
this post I will give a brief summary of the performance.

Here is a statistical summary:

```
         Mark
mean     67.303030
std       8.625371
min      44.000000
25%      62.500000
50%      68.000000
75%      73.500000
max      88.000000
```

My favourite
paper is not actually the top mark this year as it could have probably been
executed slightly better.

I have tried to write detailed and helpful feedback on the work with the hope
that it will prove useful to you for your group project.
**I welcome all discussions about your individual coursework, if you would like
to me to discuss your coursework please do get in touch.**

If you're interested you can find a list of all the past projects at
[the assessment page](<({{site.baseurl}}/_assessment/)>).

Thanks again for all the effort you put into this assessment. As always,
there were a few standout projects this year that really impressed meâ€”even
from students I had not spoken to much during the semester, these always prove to
be a wonderful surprise. That said, what
I enjoy most is getting to chat with you throughout the semester and watching your ideas take shape along the way.
