On Friday you spent some time filling in the mid module feedback for Game
Theory. Here I will go over some of the recurring points raised.

### Please note any features of this module that you feel work well, and why they help you to learn. :

I won't delve too much here but first of all: thank you to all of you who wrote
some kind words here. I value the opportunity to teach over any other aspect of
my career and it means a lot to me.

The general consensus of the comments was a high quality of the notes and also a
general enthusiasm about the class time we spend together.

### Please note any features of this module that you feel have not worked well, and suggest any potential changes that might help to address these

#### My class management:

> "Just start the lectures instead of waiting for everyone - being too polite cuts our lecture time down."

> "Waiting for us to be silent, as soon as you start talking we will stop and listen." (Part 1/2) 

I'm afraid that I won't change how I start class. My approach of waiting for you
to finish whatever you are doing is not a question of politeness, but more about
emphasising that this is your class, not mine. In my experience if I start
speaking before you are all ready you will (as would I!) continue your
conversation (even if it's silently).

I will always (subject to a bike traffic jam on the Taf trail) be on time and
ready to start at 0900.

> "also when people are late when you stop, it makes me not want to come in if i’m slightly late - which defeats the point - counterproductive" (Part 2/2)

I certainly see how it could theoretically be counterproductive. In practice it
seems to not stop students (this has been happening for the entirety of my
career) so perhaps there's a balance. I again: do not want to make anyone feel
bad for being late, I don't mind at all if someone is late -- I understand this
happens. I'm glad that anyone makes it to class whenever they do and I'll
continue to give late comers a chance to put down there things and be ready to
not miss more than they already have.

#### Structure

> "Sometimes because of how interactive the sessions are, it feels like there’s no structure/direction."

> "The lesson structure seems very random (or at least I find it hard to follow). At the moment it feels most of my notes I have made are very random and scattered"

This is a recurring theme of all classes I teach. The classes are indeed very
unstructured and I understand how this can be unnerving. What I aim to have in
place to alleviate this is a strong and clear structure on the class site:

- The schedule is here: [vknight.org/gt/](https://vknight.org/gt/)
- For every topic in that schedule there are links to the relevant section of
  [the class text book](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io) as well as those links
  there are videos for each section.
- After every class I write a class log to summarise and confirm the underlying
  structure of the class: [vknight.org/gt/#blog](https://vknight.org/gt/#blog)

I realise this is still far from the traditional structure given by a class
where you go to class to write the notes and then revise the notes. If there is
anything I can do to further signpost and improve things: I want to do it.

#### Group Coursework

> "Clearer group coursework description and criteria"

> "Examples of projects would be great."

> "I would have liked more explanation about what is expected from the group project earlier on in the module"

> "id like an actual “question” or “brief” for the courseworks, just for the sake of clarity"

This is another recurring theme of all the class I teach as I often have open
ended assignments. I would love to get better at signposting and reassuring
students here.

This year a student suggested listing the titles of past courseworks which I
think is a great idea so that has been done here:
[vknight.org/gt/assessment/#past-group-projects](https://vknight.org/gt/assessment/#past-group-projects).
I will continue (similarly to the [Valentine's day
class](https://vknight.org/gt//2023/02/14/valentines-day.html)) to give further
examples of what's expected. I won't however give you past recordings or past
papers written by students: this is purely because I do not want you to be
influenced. Please do feel able to come and speak to me: I am happy to give you
specific guidance for whatever it is you want to do.

I have added to the [assessment](vknight.org/gt/assessment/) page a short brief
of what is expected:

> "Carry out a group research project using Game Theory. This can either be a
>  theoretical exploration of a topic of Game Theory or an applied problem:
>  investigating some interactive process using the tools of the course."

#### Individual coursework

> "More information on the coursework, unable to open the individual coursework example, would be nice to see past coursework, and past group courseworks"

The mock coursework is available and I have added an faq with guidance on how to
open a Jupyter notebook in case it's unclear. If anyone has further trouble with
this: please get in touch.

The typical programming exercises on each topic also give expectations of what
you will be asked to do.

#### Access to Vince


> "The office hours aren’t written on the website as of writing this - which makes it hard to find when we can talk to you."

> "If we don’t understand a concept, and especially if it requires more explanation, it can be hard to get help, it would be nice if there was more times we can contact you."

The office hours are indeed not written anywhere on the site: Friday from 1400
until 1600.

Alternatively I am always happy to meet when free. The reality is that I have a
very dense schedule so it might be hard for us to find a time BUT email me and I
will always do anything I can to find time.

#### Other

> "The videos are useful but I find as there’s so many I can’t concentrate on them so rarely watch them all. Do we need to watch the videos and read the notes? Or is one or the other fine?"

The videos and notes are there for you to use as is best. I would probably
suggest reading the notes and then watching the corresponding video to confirm
you have understood things.

> "going through lecture notes more clearly"

I believe the videos recordings do this BUT if I'm wrong and they are not clear
please let me know.

> "I would like more help on the coding side of the course"

There are videos and note for every topic going over the coding aspects of the
course, I continue also to meet with students to help with coding aspects. BUT
if there is something more I can be doing here I would like to know.

> "Where did you get the best cookies from?"

> "C O O K I E S !!!"

The cookies are from the ["Naked
Vegan"](https://thenakedvegan.co.uk/celebration-cakes/) which is in the Cardiff
Indoor market.

I'm glad you enjoyed them :).
