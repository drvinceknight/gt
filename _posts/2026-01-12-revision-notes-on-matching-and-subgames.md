Last week I went over two specific examples:

- Matching games
- Subgame perfection

You can find the board I wrote on [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025-2026/boards/2026-01-09/main.pdf)

I worked through the Gale Shapley algorithm for the examples in that pdf and
then I went over the solutions to exercise 3 from the subgame perfection chapter
of the course.
