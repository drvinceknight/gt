I am going to be away from Cardiff from Week 5 (starting 26th of February) until Easter.

This does imply some changes to the timetable for the first four weeks of the
Semester. Do check your timetable carefully:

- Week 1:
  - Tuesday 30th of January at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 30th of January at 1710 in Main 1.122 (Small Chemistry LT).
  - Friday 2nd of February at 1110 in Tower 0.01.
- Week 2:
  - Monday 5th of February at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 6th of February at 1110 in Abacws 0.01.
  - Friday 9th of February at 1110 in Tower 0.01.
- Week 3:
  - Tuesday 13th of February at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 13th of February at 1710 in Main 1.122 (Small Chemistry LT).
  - Friday 16th of February at 1110 in Abacws 0.01.
- Week 4:
  - Monday 19th of February at 1000 in Abacws 2.26.
  - Tuesday 20th of February at 1110 in Abacws 0.01.
  - Friday 23rd of February at 1110 in Tower 0.01.

The schedule you can see [here]({{site.baseurl}}/) includes
an expected schedule.

I will be scheduling a virtual support session during my time away from Cardiff
and will be available to meet virtually if I can be helpful.
