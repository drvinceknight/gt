In class today we played a [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://youtu.be/IFurn06BDuc?si=FoP8IS_efnK4UVOa) tournament.

A recording of the class is available [here](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=97c748da-afc6-4e2d-8fda-b27b01089402).

A summary of the rules of Rock Paper Scissors are available
[here](https://github.com/drvinceknight/gt/blob/main/do/static/rpsls/main.pdf).

After everyone played their tournaments (a knock out with a final)
following that there was a "last player standing" session which lead to the
grand final. **Osian** was victorious here and indeed he also beat me.
We had a conversation about what made a good strategy for this game.

We spoke a bit about the fact that Osian did not play Lizard or Spock so we
approximated his strategy as:

$$\sigma_r=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 0, 0)$$

I then spoke a bit about how we could find a Nash equilibrium (a pair of best
responses) using the support enumeration algorithm which is what we shall attack
in the next class.
