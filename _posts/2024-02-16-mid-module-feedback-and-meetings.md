On Tuesday we had two class. We went through your mid module feedback
and had a brief discussion about meetings.

You can see recordings here:

- Morning class: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8e9ed37d-450e-44d1-a997-b11000c663b7](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8e9ed37d-450e-44d1-a997-b11000c663b7)
- Afternoon class: [https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=545a3dde-9dbe-4367-875d-b11100a5cc4f](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=545a3dde-9dbe-4367-875d-b11100a5cc4f)

Some direct actions I have taken as a result of your feedback:

- I have uploaded a video demonstrating how to install Nashpy. You can find it
  here: [{{site.baseurl}}/topics/normal-form-games.html]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/normal-form-games.html)
- I spoke at length about the individual and also the group coursework.
  Specifically I described a number of projects listed here: [{{site.baseurl}}/assessment/]({{site.baseurl}}/assessment/)

At this stage there is nothing I can do about the compressed nature of the
timetable. I am aware of this and I hope I have reassured you that I have your
best interests at heart.

After discussing feedback we also talked about meetings. This was a bit rushed
but I think we covered everything. You can find a link to a number of principles
on meetings here: [{{site.baseurl}}/topics/meetings.html]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/meetings.html)

Below I have listed all the comments you raised. This is mainly in the interest
of future students considering whether or not to pick this course.

### Please note any features of this module that you feel work well, and why they help you to learn. :

```
YouTube videos are useful and lessons are interactive

The classes are fun, and the practical implementation of game theory topics via games is useful

I like how interactive it is

All of the notes on a well structured website

Like collaborative teaching style

I think that the games we play in lectures are fun and helpful to understand the "lecture notes"

I enjoy the discussions and interactive aspects of this module

Happy with the unique structure of the module, short timeframe is slightly stressful but can't be helped.

Collaborative teaching

The interactive lectures are really cool, and enjoyable. The lecture notes and videos explaining them also work really well.

Interactive

The constant switch between practical and theory applied in class to implement a stronger understanding.

Interactive and fun

interactive classes, good back and forth between Vince and the class, good structured notes

The website is clearly laid out, easy to make notes from

The games keep it fun and keep everyone engaged

lessons are interactive and still help us learn about game theory

Videos as well as notes online

The interactive parts of the module

YouTube videos are really good length, makes the content a lot more manageable when it's broken down into smaller chunks

"The lectures are great fun, the fun of the lectures helps break routine of usual lectures and take in the content
The website and youtube is also very helpful in understanding content"

Nice to see the notes get applied in real life situations and the open chats have been useful

The notes are very easy to digest and the examples in them help

The nashpy notes are very detailed and easy to read

Interactive

Prefer the double lecture hours in first month to give more time to work on coursework later

Breaking up the lectures with interactive scenarios

Interactive lectures are useful and the youtube videos and notes are easy to follow

Interactive activities during class help to see how concepts can be applied

interactive and organised

The notes are detailed and exercises are accessible

Multiple think pair share opportunities help to consolidate knowledge and understanding

I like the website, it’s much more convenient than using learning central.

Really enjoy discussions in lectures

Interactive lectures, seems to be a general consensus of enjoyment towards the module and enthusiasm shown in group work and discussion

Interacting with the students,  rather than you talking at us for an hour straight

Nice lecturer

The Short form YouTube videos that can consolidate knowledge after attending a lecture

The course materials on Vinces website are helpful. Lectures are engaging. I like that the module is completely coursework based.

Very Interactive

website is formatted well and easy to find everything to practice game theory in python

Clear notes on website and interactive website reinforce learning

I like that the lectures feel very active, and that I’m not just sitting and taking notes for the entirety of it. It feels more engaging.

Very interactive module. Applying things into practice.

Putting ideas into practice with actual games makes it easier to understand

lectures are fun, so easier to stay concentrated

How interactive and engaging the lectures are. As well as the youtube videos and exercises online

The use of youtube videos and lecture notes of content combined with the collaborative teaching really helps solidify my understanding of the content

The exercise questions are great way to test us on what we’ve learnt

The website is really useful for looking through notes and videos

All coursework ease exam pressure

The Nashpy library is really structured with examples and example code which I find incredibly helpful.

Interactive, not just listen and write

the way you interact with us is really engaging and i appreciate that. it’s nice to come to class and actually feel like you can participate and discuss

I think the website works quite well, easier to use than learning central, and the videos are helpful

Chocolate bribes help

As interesting as you want it to be

Playing games and putting then applying the theory to them (real life application)! I find myself understanding and following the class when I read up on the lecture notes in my own time

Self-study is nice

bit random sometimes

The group project seems quite vague

interactive learning and comprehensive schedule

```

### Please note any features of this module that you feel have not worked well, and suggest any potential changes that might help to address these

```
I would prefer topics directly from the book are discussed - ie the more difficult concepts are gone over.

Maybe a video showing how to download nashpy

Would like to see more examples of previous group projects

I enjoy the lectures :)

Remembering to read the lecture notes as they’re not covered in the lecture

A bit more of a brief on the group coursework

N/A

Timetabling

N/a

More frequent reminders for online notes/videos

Not so much a fault of the module itself but due to the timetabling and having so many classes it has been difficult to get through all the content as it's taught

I don't think having all the classes packed into a few weeks is very fair

Slightly unclear about assessments

Could maybe have more questions / interactive quizzes (like menti)  in lectures and outside of lectures

Although interactive, Still don’t really know what’s going on in this module or what we’re working towards. The material on your website seems a lot more difficult compared to material we’ve gone thru

Clearer distinction in class between examples and the concepts to be learned

More demonstration of code or how to model in the lectures would be helpful

There’s only a small focus on the notes in lectures, and it feels like we go through content very quickly without fully focussing on some points in the notes

As someone who doesn’t know anyone in the class, turning to a neighbor can sometimes be tough

sometimes neglect the notes/videos in own time, slightly stressed about unstructured group coursework, maybe more guidance will be helpful but cant know yet

A lot of content in a short space of time

:)

All good

Structure confusing

Can’t be helped but it’s harder to keep up with the exercises in time with the lectures so slightly behind

Tim winning RPS

it’s not something i really want to be changed,  i think this class can seem quite overwhelming just because it’s so different study wise (the change is challenging) but i don’t want that to changelol

N/A

Talking about the groip coursework more would be helpful. Its a bit of a shot in the dark

Not enough discussing about what we have to do on the group project, it was a bit vague

I would like it to be a bit more clear what topic in the notes we’re discussing, maybe just at the start of the lecture

Whats required for assessments unclear

The mathematical notation in the online notes sometimes seems a bit off. I prefer it when I can (mostly) work out how something works without an example, but with these the examples are needed

The website is almost too accessible, making it seem less useful to do wider reading

More online quizzes would be better to consolidate knowledge

Maybe go through how to code a bit more

"I feel like I don't have enough time between lectures to look at the course
notes and videos"

maybe more lecture video

```
