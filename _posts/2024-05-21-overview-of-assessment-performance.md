In this post I will discuss the performance of the class:

- Summarise the overall performance of the class (including [the performance on
  the individual coursework]({{site.baseurl}}/2024/04/16/individual-coursework-feedback.html));
- Summarise the performance of the class on the group coursework

**Note that at this point in time the marks are provisional and could be scaled
by the Exam board.** I do not expect this to happen as the marks distributions
are within a reasonable range of the University guidelines (TLDR: they are slightly
higher than the norm).

## Overall class performance

A summary of the overall class performance is given here:

The University guidelines

The group coursework is a difficult assessment marked on a difficult scale.
Summary of the class marks are here:

```txt
count    82
mean     66.54
std      10.08
min      37
25%      59.65
50%      67.20
75%      71.80
max      88
```

The average is a bit above the University guidelines which are that the mean class mark
should be within \\(62 \pm \frac{80}{\sqrt{n}}\\) where \\(n\\) is 82 in this class (the
number of students in the class).

## Group class performance

I was incredibly impressed with the work you accomplished this Semester. Some
projects where really innovative and well executed.

A summary of the class marks are here:

```txt
count    82
mean     53.78
std      10.56
min      35.00
25%      47.00
50%      50.00
75%      55.00
max      80
```

This is similar to the marks from last year where the median was 53.

Thank you again for your work this year. If you would like to discuss your marks
