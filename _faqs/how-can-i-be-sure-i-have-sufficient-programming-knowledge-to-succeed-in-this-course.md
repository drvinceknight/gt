title: Can I succeed in this course even if I am unsure about my programming ability?
---

The programming required to complete this course is mainly making calls to the
Nashpy library. There is little to no writing of your own algorithms or code
required. Historically, students who have been concerned about this have not
been impeded by their programming ability.
