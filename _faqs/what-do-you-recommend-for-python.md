title:  What do you recommend for Python?
---

I recommend using the Anaconda distribution for Python which includes a large
number of libraries for doing mathematics.
Here are some resources that you might find helpful:

1. A chapter of my first year text on installing and using Python: https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/introduction/main.html
2. A chapter of my first year text on installing and using other libraries: https://vknight.org/pfm/further-information/04-pip-installing/introduction/main.html
