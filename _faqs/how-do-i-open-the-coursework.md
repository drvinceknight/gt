title:  How do I open the individual coursework notebook
---

1. Right click on the link to the coursework and save the file to your
   computer (make a note of where it is on your computer).
2. **Do not double click on the file you have downloaded.** (see
   https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/why/main.html#why-can-i-not-double-click-on-a-jupyter-notebook-file
   for an explanation).
3. Start a Jupyter notebook server (see
   https://vknight.org/pfm/tools-for-mathematics/01-using-notebooks/how/main.html#start-a-jupyter-notebook-server
   for instructions).
4. Using the Jupyter notebook interface navigate to the notebook file you
   saved on your computer in step 1 and click on it.
