    \question
    Which statement best describes the Moran process?

    \begin{checkboxes}
        \choice The Moran process models evolutionary dynamics in a finite population where individuals are chosen for reproduction proportional to their fitness, and the offspring replace a randomly selected individual.
            \choice The Moran process describes the evolution of a population where all individuals reproduce simultaneously, and their offspring compete for a limited number of vacant spots.
            \choice The Moran process assumes that individuals reproduce at rates inversely proportional to their fitness, leading to the eventual extinction of the fittest strategy.
            \choice The Moran process models how a population evolves by replacing multiple individuals at each step based on a fitness-weighted lottery.
    \end{checkboxes}

    \question What is the probability of selection of each type in the Moran Process
    with a population vector \(v=(3, 2, 4)\) for the following payoff matrix:

    \[
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & 15 & 1\\
            4 & 10 & 2\\
            2 & 9  & 8
        \end{pmatrix}
    \]

    \begin{checkboxes}
        \choice First type: \(1/5\), second type: \(2/5\), third type: \(4/5\).
        \choice First type: \(1/3\), second type: \(1/3\), third type: \(1/3\).
        \choice First type: \(3/10\), second type: \(1/6\), third type: \(8/15\).
        \choice First type: \(2/5\), second type: \(1/6\), third type: \(13/30\).
    \end{checkboxes}

    \question What is the probability of fixation \(x_1\) for the following
    game:

    \[
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 9\\
        4 & 8
        \end{pmatrix}
    \]

    \begin{checkboxes}
        \choice \(1/4\)
        \choice \(1/5\)
        \choice \(22/7\)
        \choice \(12/43\)
