\question Which statement best describes a strategy in a Normal Form Game?
\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice A strategy in a Normal Form Game is a plan that specifies a way for a player to chose an action.
    \choice A strategy in a Normal Form Game is the choice of actions a player takes, chosen after observing the actions of all other players.
    \choice A strategy in a Normal Form Game refers to a player's selection of a single action that maximizes their payoff in the current round, without considering other actions.
    \choice A strategy in a Normal Form Game is a method for a player to randomize between actions, ensuring that no other player can predict their choices.
\end{checkboxes}

\question Given the action set \(\mathcal{A} = (\alpha, \beta, \gamma,
    \epsilon)\) what is the support of the strategy \(\sigma=(1/3, 0, 0, 2/3)\)

\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice \(\{\alpha, \beta\}\)
    \choice \(\{\epsilon, \gamma, \beta\}\)
    \choice \(\{\alpha, \epsilon\}\)
\end{checkboxes}


\question Consider the game with payoff matrices: 
    \[
        A=\begin{pmatrix}4 & 3 & 4\\
                       0 & 5 & -1\\
                       1 & 1 & 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
        \qquad
        B=\begin{pmatrix}3 & 7 & 4\\
                       -1 & 2 & 3\\
                       -10 & 3 & 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    and the strategies \(\sigma_r = (1, 0 ,0)\) and \(\sigma_c=(1/2, 1/4,
    1/4)\). What are the utilities to both players:

\begin{checkboxes}
    \choice \(u_r=3.6\) and \(u_c=5.3\).
    \choice \(u_r=3.75\) and \(u_c=4.25\).
    \choice \(u_r=3.6\) and \(u_c=15.3\).
\end{checkboxes}
