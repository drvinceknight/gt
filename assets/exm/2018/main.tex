    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Give the definition of Normal Form Game.
        ~\hfill{[2]}
        \item Consider the Normal Form Game with
            the following matrix representation:
            $$A=
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    1 & -2\\
                    -2 & 1
                \end{pmatrix}
              \qquad
              B=
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    -2 & 1\\
                    1 & -2
                \end{pmatrix}
            $$

            Consider the mixed strategies for the row/column players
            \(\sigma_r=(x,1-x)\)/\(\sigma_c(y,1-y)\). Sketch a plot of:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Of the row player's utilities: \(u_r((1, 0), \sigma_c)\)
                    and \(u_r((0, 1), \sigma_c)\).
                    ~\hfill{[1]}
                \item Of the column player's utilities: \(u_r(\sigma_r, (1, 0))\)
                    and \(u_c(\sigma_r, (0, 1))\).
                    ~\hfill{[1]}
            \end{itemize}

            Using the plot obtain the best responses of both
            players.~\hfill{[1]}

        \item Give a proof of the following theorem:

              In a two player game $(A,B)\in{\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}}^2$ a mixed
              strategy $\sigma_r^*$  of the row player is a best response to a
              column players' strategy $\sigma_c$ if and only if:

              $${\sigma_r^*}_i > 0 \Rightarrow (A\sigma_c^T)_i =
              \max_{k}(A\sigma_c^T)_k\text{ for all }1\leq i\leq m$$

              ~\hfill{[5]}

        \item Using the above theorem, confirm the findings of question 2.
              ~\hfill{[5]}

        \item Consider the accompanying 2017 paper entitled ``Measuring the price
            of anarchy in critical care unit interactions'' by Knight et al.

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Give a general summary of the paper.~\hfill{[3]}
                \item What is the main theoretic result of the
                    paper?~\hfill{[2]}
                \item Identify a specific modelling assumption made that limits
                    the work.~\hfill{[2]}
                \item Propose an approach that could be used to overcome
                    this limit factor.~\hfill{[3]}
            \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Give the definition of repeated game.
            ~\hfill{[2]}
        \item Give the definition of strategy in a repeated game.
            ~\hfill{[2]}
        \item Obtain all possible histories for the 2 stage repeated game with
            the following stage game:

            \[
                A = \begin{pmatrix}
                    5 & 2 & 1\\

            \]

            Where \(S_1, S_2\) are the strategy spaces for the stage game for
            both players and \(H(t)\) is the history of play at stage \(t\).
            ~\hfill{[5]}

            that are sequence
            of stage Nash equilibria.
            ~\hfill{[3]}

        \item Obtain a Nash equilibrium that is not a sequence of stage Nash
            equilibria for the repeated game of question 3. Justify this.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Give the definition of a Moran process on a game.
            ~\hfill{[4]}
		\item Consider a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ representing a

			$$f_{1i}=\frac{a(i-1)+b(N-i)}{N-1}$$
$$f_{2i}=\frac{c(i)+d(N-i-1)}{N-1}$$

			For the Moran process on this game, prove that the fixation
probability \(x_i\) (of \(i\) individuals of the first type taking over the
population) is given by:

			$$
x_i=\frac{1+\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\prod_{k=1}^j\frac{f_{2k}}{f_{1k}}}{1+\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\prod_{k=1}^j\frac{f_{2k}}{f_{1k}}}
