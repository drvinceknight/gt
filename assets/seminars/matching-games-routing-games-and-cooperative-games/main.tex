\note{
    Let us start with a slightly different type of game.

    The set of small letters on the left wants to be matched with the sets of
    small letter on the right.

    Each of their preference is indicated in the brackets. For example \(a\)
    would prefer to be matched with \(A\) over \(B\) over \(C\).

    Can you identify a potential matching?

\section{Matching Games}

\frame{
    \begin{definition}
        A matching game of size \(N\) is defined by two disjoint sets \(S\) and
        \(R\) or suitors and reviewers of size \(N\). Associated to each element of
        \(S\) and \(R\) is a preference list:

        \[f:S\to R^N\text{ and }g:R\to S^N\]

    \end{definition}
}

\note{So this is a formal definition of the situation we had above.

We had \(N=3\).

\[S=\{a, b, c\}\]

and 

\[R=\{A, B, C\}\]
}

\frame{
    \begin{definition}
        A matching \(M\) is any bijection between \(S\) and \(R\). If \(s\in S\)
        and \(r\in R\) are matched by \(M\) we denote:

        \[M(s)=r\]
    \end{definition}
}

\note{
    Here is our formal definition of what we are looking for: a matching.
}

\frame{
    
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    \node (a) [end] at (0,0) {};
    \node (b) [end] at (0,1) {};
    \node (c) [end] at (0,2) {};
    \node (A) [end] at (2,0) {};
    \node (B) [end] at (2,1) {};
    \node (C) [end] at (2,2) {};
    \node [left] at (a) {$a$: $(A,B,C)$};
    \node [left] at (b) {$b$: $(B,C,A)$};
    \node [left] at (c) {$c$: $(B,A,C)$};
    \node [right] at (A) {$A$: $(b,c,a)$};
    \node [right] at (B) {$B$: $(a,c,b)$};
    \node [right] at (C) {$C$: $(a,b,c)$};
    \draw (a) -- (A);
    \draw (b) -- (B);
    \draw (c) -- (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
}

\note{
    Here is a matching.

    If you look closely you might notice that there is some instability here.

    \(c\) would prefer to be matched with \(B\) over their current matching
    \textbf{and} \(B\) would prefer to be matched with \(c\) over their current
    matching.
}

\frame{
    \begin{definition}
        A pair \((s,r)\) is said to \textbf{block} a matching \(M\) if \(M(s)\ne r\)
        but \(s\) prefers \(r\) to \(M(r)\) and \(r\) prefers \(s\) to
        \(M^{-1}(r)\).
    \end{definition}
}

\note{
    In the case of the proposed matching \((c,B)\) is a blocking pair.

        \node [left] at (c) {\(c\): \((B,A,C)\)};
        \node [right] at (A) {\(A\): \((b,c,a)\)};
        \node [right] at (B) {\(B\): \((a,c,b)\)};
        \node [right] at (C) {\(C\): \((a,b,c)\)};

        \draw (a) -- (B);
        \draw (b) -- (C);
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \note{
        This is a stable matching. 

        Can we always find one?

            \item Pick some unmatched \(s\in S\), let \(r\) be the top of
                \(s\)'s preference list:

                    \item If \(r\) is unmatched set $M(s)=r$

                            \item If \(r\) prefers \(s\) to \(M^{-1}(r)\) then set \(M(r)=s\)
                            \item Otherwise \(s\) remains unmatched and remove \(r\) from \(s\)'s preference list.
                        \end{enumerate}
                \end{enumerate}
            \item Repeat step 2 until all \(s\in S\) are matched.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}
}

\note{
    This is the algorithm that they define and in fact there are number of
    theoretic results that hold for this algorithm. For example:

    \begin{theorem}
        All possible executions of the Gale-Shapley algorithm yield the same
        stable matching and in this stable matching every suitor has the
        best possible partner in any stable matching.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}
        In a suitor-optimal stable matching each reviewer has the worst possible
        matching.

\note{
    Here is another type of game. Imagine having an infinite amount of traffic
    that needs to get from the two sources here \(s_1, s_2\) to the sink \(t\).
    If of the roads (arcs on this network) have different amounts of congestion.
    Perhaps one of them is a road that can handle more traffic efficiently which
    makes it popular. Which in turn makes it slower.

    This is what is called a routing game.
}

\frame{
    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{routing game} \((G,r,c)\) is defined on a graph \(G=(V,E)\) with a defined set of 
        sources \(s_i\) and sinks \(t_i\). 

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each source-sink pair corresponds to a set of traffic 
        (also called a commodity) \(r_i\) that must travel along the edges of \(G\) from \(s_i\) to \(t_i\). 
            \item Every edge \(e\) of \(G\) has associated to it a nonnegative, continuous and nondecreasing 
        cost function (also called latency function) \(c_e\).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}
}

\note{
    This is the formal definition of the routing game.
}

\frame{
    \begin{definition}
        For a routing game \((G,r,c)\) we define the optimal flow \(f^*\) as the
        solution to the following optimisation problem:

        \vspace{1cm}
        Minimise: \[\sum_{e\in E}c_e(f_e)f_e\]:

        Subject to:

        \[\begin{aligned}
            \sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}_i}f_P&=r_i&&\text{for all }i\\
            f_e&=\sum_{P\in\mathcal{P}\text{ if }e\in P}f_P&&\text{ for all }e\in E\\
            f_P&\geq 0
        \end{aligned}\]
    \end{definition}
}

\note{
    This is the formal definition of the optimal flow. Importantly, this is
    actually an easy problem mathematically (it's a convex optimisation
    problem).
}

\frame{
    For a routing game \((G,r,c)\) a flow \(\tilde f\) is called a 
    \textbf{Nash flow}
    if and only if for every commodity \(i\) and any two paths
    \(P_1,P_2\in\mathcal{P}_i\) such that \(f_{P_1}>0\) then:
    }

    \frame{
        \begin{definition}
            If \(c\) is a differentiable cost function then we define the
            \textbf{marginal cost} function \(c^*\) as:

            \[c^*=\frac{d}{dx}(xc(x))\]
        \end{definition}
    }

    \note{
        This however is the definition of a Nash flow.

        It is saying that if a particular path is used by traffic that that path
        must have minimal cost.

        This implies that the equilibrium is when all traffic is routed along
        minimal costing paths. In other words: no one has a reason to deviate.

    \note{
        This is called Braess' Paradox.

        The optimal flow in this case is for half the flow to go along the top
        and half the flow to go along the bottom.

        The Paradox here is that by the addition of a resources (the super road)
        the congestion increases.

        There are real life examples of this: for example the Big Dig in Boston.

        their cost.

        A \textbf{characteristic function game} \(G\) is given by a pair \((N,v)\) where

    the fare be for each coalition of players:

        Is there a way to share out the fare in a way that matches these four
        axiomatic properties:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The entire fare is paid.
            \item People who are not in the taxi do not pay.
            \item If people go the same distance they pay the same amount.
            \item It doesn't matter which taxi is taken.

\note{
    The answer is yes: Lloyd Shapley (him again) came up with an approach to do this.

    It is now referred to as the Shapley value.

}

\frame{
    Given \(G=(N,v)\) the \textbf{Shapley value} of player \(i\) is denoted by \(\phi_i(G)\) and given by:

\[\phi_i(G)=\frac{1}{N!}\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_n}\Delta_\pi^G(i)\]

where:


\[S_\pi(i)=\{j\in[N]\;|\;\pi(j)<\pi(i)\}\]

and 


\[\Delta_\pi^G(i)=v(S_{\pi}(i)\cup i)-v(S_{\pi}(i))\]
}

\frame{
    The Shapley value is the average vector that corresponds to the marginal
    contributions of each player in any given permutation of the players.

    Imagine letting people out of the taxi in random orders and they each pay
    what is owed at the time.

\note{
    Here is another example application.

    In this simple version of `AI' (it's just fitting a linear function to some
    data) we can try to see the effect each variable makes. What explains the
    contribution more?

    \(R^2\) is a measure of explained variability in a given model.

    The Shapley value can be used here to see how best to attribute the total
    \(R^2\).
