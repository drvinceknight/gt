    "The **Python 3** code used in this course uses the following external libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Sympy](http://www.sympy.org/): for symbolic mathematics.\n",
    "- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/): for numeric mathematics.\n",
    "- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/): mainly for the numerical solver of differential equations.\n",
    "- [Nashpy](http://nashpy.readthedocs.io/): for Nash equilibria computation.\n",
    "- [Axelrod](http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/): for Iterated Prisoner Dilemma experiments.\n",

    "## Installing Python and the required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to install Python and the required library and any operating system (Windows, OSX, linux) is to use a scientific distribution called Anaconda. Go to the following link https://www.continuum.io/downloads and download the installer corresponding to your system. **Be sure to choose Python 3 and not Python 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are installation instruction online:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For windows: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/windows\n",
    "- For OSX: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/mac-os\n",
    "- For linux: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/linux.html\n",
    "\n",
    "To check your install has worked correctly open:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the \"Command prompt\" on Windows.\n",
    "- the \"terminal\" on OSX or linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "type `python` and press `Enter`. This should display a screen that looks something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:53:06) \n",
    "[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The version numbers might look different but the word `Anaconda` should be there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done that, type `exit()` and press `Enter` to exit the Python prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have Python along with Sympy, Numpy, Scipy and a number of other useful libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing game theory libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "To install **Nashpy** and **Axelrod**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the \"Command Prompt\" on Windows.\n",
    "- the \"terminal\" on OSX or linux.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install nashpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip instal axelrod\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After each one of those press `Enter`. This should download and install the required software.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**If you are using a machine for which you do not have administrative rights (for example a University lab computer)** instead you should type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --user nashpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --user axelrod\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Python I recommend using the Jupyter notebook (a popular tool in scientific computation - and also the tool used to build this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to run the Jupyter server, one is to type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the Command Prompt/Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all [chapters](http://vknight.org/gt/chapters/) are available as jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files). You can download them and modify/execute the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more Python there are a number of great resources online, you can also take a look at my Computing for Mathematics course which is an introduction to Python for mathematicians: http://vknight.org/cfm"
