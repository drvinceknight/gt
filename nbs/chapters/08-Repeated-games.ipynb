    "\n",
    "Using backwards induction, this is a Nash equilibrium for the last stage game. Thus, at the last stage, no player has a reason to deviate. Similarly at the $T-1$th stage. The proof follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, for our example we have the four Nash equilibria:\n",

    "- $(r_2r_2, c_1c_3)$ with utility: (6, 2).\n",

    "- $(r_2r_2, c_3c_3)$ with utility: (10, 2).\n",

    "In a repeated game it is possible for players to encode reputation and trust in their strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following two strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the row player:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$(\\emptyset, \\emptyset) \\to r_1$$\n",
    "   $$(r_1, c_1) \\to r_2$$\n",
    "   $$(r_1, c_2) \\to r_2$$\n",
    "   $$(r_1, c_3) \\to r_2$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. For the column player:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$(\\emptyset, \\emptyset) \\to c_2$$\n",
    "   $$(r_1, c_2) \\to c_3$$\n",

    "Note that here we omit some of the histories which are not possible based on the first play by each player.\n",

    "This strategy corresponds to the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Play $(r_1,c_2)$ in first stage and $(r_2,c_3)$ in second stage unless the row player does not cooperate in which case play $(r_2, c_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both players play these strategies their utilities are: $(11, 4)$ which is better **for both players** then the utilities at any sequence of pure stage Nash equilibria. **But** is this a Nash equilibrium? To find out we investigate if either player has an incentive to deviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the row player deviates, they would only be rational to do so in the first stage, if they did they would gain 1 in that stage but lose 4 in the second stage. Thus they have no incentive to deviate.\n",
    "2. If the column player deviates, they would only do so in the first stage and gain no utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus this strategy pair **is a Nash equilibrium** and evidences how a reputation can be built and cooperation can emerge from complex dynamics."
