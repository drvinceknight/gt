00 Introduction to class
========================

Pre class email
---------------

Send the following email before class::

    Hi all,

    I hope you are all well.

    This is a brief email before our first class <>

    All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
    https://vknight.org/gt/.

    Here is an invite link to a discord server we will be using for this class:
    https://discord.gg/FCTyXP3G

    I realise that some of you are no doubt still deciding whether or not you
    will choose the Game Theory this Semester (even more so given that the
    course assessment is different from previous years). During our first class
    tomorrow I will hopefully answer any questions you have but please don't
    hesitate to ask (then, before or after) if there's anything you'd like to
    know as you choose your modules.

    Please get in touch if I can assist with anything,
    Vince

Timetable and approach
**********************

Discuss timetable

**I will not lecture**

This course is taught in a flipped learning environment. All notes, homework,
exercises are available to you.

In class we will work in parallel to the notes but not directly following them.
You will be expected to play an active role in your learning:

- Activities that demonstrate concepts;
- Discussions


Feedback
********

Show feedback from previous year.

Learning and assessment
***********************

All resources can be found at http://vknight.org/gt/

Seeking assistance
******************

Details on website.

Programming
***********

The course notes will include code throughout, this is both to show you how to
use code to study mathematics (an exemplar of modern mathematics) but also to
illustrate the ideas.

Details about the programming involved can be found at
http://vknight.org/gt/other/programming/

The first assessment is a coding exercise: this is to highlight that I am not
interested in mathematical button pushing. I want you to become game theorists
by doing this course.

Kindness
********

Highlight the kindness section.

Introduction to games
*********************

**Virtual modification:** Use MentiMeter:

1. Send link to first round
