00 Introduction to class
========================

Pre class email
---------------

Send the following email before class::

    Hi all,

    I hope you are all well.

    This is a brief email before our first class on Monday at 1000 am.

    All of the course materials (including short videos) are available at
    https://vknight.org/gt/.

    Our classes will be on Zoom:

    - Zoom link: https://cardiff.zoom.us/my/vknightÂ 
    - Password is: 401665

    Before each class I will also send you that again via email.

    I realise that some of you are no doubt still deciding whether or not you
    will choose the Game Theory this Semester. During our first class on Monday
    I will hopefully answer any questions you have but please don't hesitate to
    use the chat if there's anything you'd like to know as you choose your
    modules.

    Important: My wife and I are expecting our second child any day now, so at
    some point over the next couple of weeks I will not be around (for a week).
    I am confident that we have sufficient time in the schedule to catch up.

    Please get in touch if I can assist with anything,
    Vince
