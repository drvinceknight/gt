AC - Coursework peer review
===========================

Corresponding assessment
------------------------

- `Individual coursework
  <https://vknight.org/gt/other/assessment/#Individual-coursework>`_

**Duration**: 50 minutes


Objectives
----------

- Use peer review to discuss and give feedback on individual coursework.

Notes
-----

5 mins: Discuss marking criteria:

- Understanding of subject (scope): the specific modelling scenario chosen is
  not terribly important but the communication of understanding **is**. Does 
  the work use
  something specific to highlight high understanding?

- Presentation: how does work align with guidelines for writing mathematics:
  
  - Inclusion of graphics?
  - Spelling/grammar?
  - Clarity

- Code: how has the code been used, is it the correct code, does it help with
  the scope? A simple use of something from the notes is what is expected but is
  it done appropriately (for example using the lemke-howson algorithm when it's
  not appropriate, plotting the incorrect thing, etc...).

5 mins: Exchange coursework with someone else.

15 mins: Read and write feedback (Encourage students to write positively).

10 mins: Pair and discuss feedback.

10 mins: Group discussion.
