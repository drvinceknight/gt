### Activity (20 Minutes)

Tell half the class they are doves and half the class they are hawks.

Ask for 3 doves to be my population and now ask for one hawk to come in.

Use the Hawk Dove Game https://vknight.org/gtb/main-1/#GdSxfAnodr to run a moran
process, telling individuals there are now dead and replaced with another
individual of the given type (use a dice).

Stop when entire population is of one type.

### Discussion (20 Minutes)

Work through the Moran Process chapter.

Discussion Point: **After the definition of the moran process,
ask how this differs from our example?**

Discussion Point: **After the definition of fixation probability, ask what the
fixation probability of a hawk is based on our simulation?**

Discussion Point: **After the theoretic fixation in two types ask how this could
be used for our example? Leave this as an exercise.**
