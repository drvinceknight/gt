## Activity (20 minutes)

Write down the derivative from the
[motivating example of the numerical integration appendix](https://vknight.org/gtb/main-15/#motivating-example-air-resistance-of-a-sky-diver).

$$
\frac{dy}{dt}=-gt^2/2+v_0t+y_0
$$

Pick some random values and slowly step through what the value of the derivative
is at each step.

Empirically come up with Euler's method of integration. Have students provide:

- Step size
- What to do next
- Etc...

## Discussion (20 minutes)

Discuss notes on numerical integration.

Discussion Point: **Ask students when it is useful to know how to do this by
hand?**
