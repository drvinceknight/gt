## Activity (20 minutes)

Use [best responses]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/activities/best_responses/main.pdf) have students play against a mixed strategy:

    >>> import random
    >>> random.seed(0)  # Don't seed in class
    >>> ["r_2", "r_1"][random.random() < 0.8]  # 80 percent chance of r_2
    'r_2'

## Discussion (20 minutes)

Discuss the **Rationalisation** chapter.

Discussion Point: **After the definition of dominance, why is dominance not relevant to the game we played?**.

Discussion Point: **How does the best response condition apply to the matching
pennies game we played in class?**
