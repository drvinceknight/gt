## Pre class email

Send the following email before class::

    Hi all,

    I hope you are all well.

    This is a brief email before our first class <>

    All of the course materials are available at
    https://vknight.org/gt/.

    I will be using the School discord server to duplicate class communication.
    If you have not joined the School discord server and would like to here is
    an invite: <>.

    I realise that some of you are no doubt still deciding whether or not you
    will choose the Game Theory this Semester. During our first class
    I will hopefully answer any questions you have but please don't hesitate to
    use the chat if there's anything you'd like to know as you choose your
    modules.

    Please get in touch if I can assist with anything,
    Vince
