## Activity (20 minutes)

Choose simple game.

Draw polytopes, ask students to use Menti (maybe?) to move and uses edges to
understand where they are.

## Discussion (20 minutes)

Discuss the **Best Response Polytopes** chapter.

Discussion Point: **After definition of labelling ask students why a fully
labeled vertex pair corresponds to a Nash equilibrium?**
