### Activity (20 Minutes)

Ask for 3 volunteers to work together.

Bring in scrap paper and ask students to practice paper airplane contest: as a
team they have to work together to create planes and throw them in to a landing
zone. The number of planes they get in the zone will be equivalent to a
bribentive.

After this, ask everyone to approximate how many planes would have been obtained
by each member of the coalition.

Before giving bribentives: ask how I can fairly give them out?

### Discussion (20 Minutes)

Work through the Cooperative Games chapter.

Discussion Point: **After definition of characteristic function game point out
that this is what we have for the paper plane game.**

Discussion Point: **After definition of marginal contribution: ask for a given
marginal contribution**

Discussion Point: **After definition of Shapley Value: ask for steps to
calculate the shapley value for the game**
