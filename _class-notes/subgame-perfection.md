## Activity (20 minutes)

Invite students to play the following game:

- Player 1 can take or pass (if take: (2,0))
  - Player 2 can take or pass (if take: (1,3))
    - Player 1 can take or pass (if take: (4,2))
      - Player 2 can take or pass (if take (3,5))
        - Leaf: (4,4)

Now ask for two students to play but they must submit their instructions. To me
(written).

Give out bribentives based on what happened.

If necessary, write down my own strategy where I pass at first two nodes but
take at last two.

Give out bribentives.

## Discussion (20 minutes)

Discuss subgame perfection chapter.

Discussion point: **After definition of backwards induction ask what this would
lead to for the centipede game?**

Discussion point: **After subgame perfection definition ask which equilibria is
subgame perfect? Or perhaps more realistically what are other NE?**
