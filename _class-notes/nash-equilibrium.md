https://vknight.org/gtb/main-1/#AfgtZmtbfU

Tell students they are going to be "speed dating" the play of this game.

Get two groups of students that like different types of movies (can be the same
as for the coordination game). Ask them to pair up and write down their choices.

Quickly compute overall utility by counting numbers.

Repeat this a few times making a note.

## Discussion (20 minutes)

Discuss the **Nash equilibrium** chapter.

Discussion Point: **After the definition of support enumeration algorithm, ask how many steps to obtain the Nash equilibrium for our game?**
