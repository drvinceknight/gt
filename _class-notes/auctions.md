### Activity (20 Minutes)

Ask class to repeat the Â£5 auction BUT this time: highest bid wins and pays the
amount the second bid. This will be done in a sealed fashion. Get everyone to
write on a piece of paper and ask them to reveal eventually.

### Discussion (20 Minutes)

Work through the Auctions chapter

Discussion Point: **After the definition of an auction, ask what the rules are
for the sealed auction we just played.**

Discussion Point: **After two theorems ask why I chose the auction I did?**
