### Activity (20 Minutes)

Ask Students to randomly choose if they are Rock, Paper or Scissors.

On board look at count and compute vector. Say that at every step students who
do below average will change to above average type.

Compute scores of each type, explaining that students randomly pairing would be
too long so use approximate $x$ to compute.

Get overall fitness and then do an evolutionary step. Repeat. Possibly plot at
the same time.

### Discussion (20 Minutes)

Work through the Replicator Dynamics Chapter

Discussion Point: **After the definition of the replicator dynamics equation,
ask how this differs from our example?**

Discussion Point: **After the definition of an ESS ask if students feel the
equilibrium for the RPS game is an ESS?**

Discussion Point: **After the characterisation of the ESS theorem ask how we
could use this to find the ESS for the replicator dynamics equation?**
