# Emergent Behavior in Complex Environments: Matching Games, Routing Games and Cooperative Games.

## Abstract

Modelling macro behavior is an important goal of a lot of applied mathematical and statistical fields.
In Game Theory it is in fact the micro behavior that is modelled so that the macro behavior can be observed.
This is an important subject that extends to applications not only in Mathematics but Economics, Biology,
Ecology and Military Sciences.

This final talk of the series will consider 3 further fields of game theory, that answer specific types of questions:

- Matching games: how create equilibrium matchings between individuals in a population?
  This has applications in resident matchings in hospitals but also in organ exchange.
- Routing games: how will an infinite populations of agents adapt to congestion?
  This has applications in transport routing.
- Cooperative games: how does a collection of agents share a common good?
  This has applications to market dynamics as well as machine learning.
