# Game Theory: Introduction to the course

Game theory is the mathematics of strategy.
It is a powerful framework for understanding how individuals and groups make decisions when their outcomes depend on others.
This module introduces the foundational models of game theory and connects them to contemporary research and real-world behaviour.

The module covers a broad range of classic and modern topics, including discussions of notable research in the field.
Most of the ideas are brought to life through interactive classroom experiments that mirror the games we study, encouraging discussion and reflection.

There’s a strong emphasis on independent learning.
While the lectures and activities build core understanding, you'll also be expected to explore the material in depth on your own.
Assessment is split between an exam and a research project.
The project gives you the chance to apply game theory authentically to a topic that interests you whether that’s sports,
technology, social behaviour, or something else entirely.

Along the way, you’ll see how game theory draws on a wide range of mathematical ideas, including integer pivoting, interior point methods,
numerical integration of differential equations, and Markov chains.
This makes this module a great option whether you’re looking to apply familiar techniques or encounter these topics for the first time.

All course materials are available online at
[vknight.org/gt/](http://vknight.org/gt/). You can also find all the source
files that create that website at
[github.com/drvinceknight/gt/](https://github.com/drvinceknight/gt/).

## Course content

There are 2 components to the course content, all of which can be found at this
site.

- The course notes we will use is the open source text book available here:
  [https://vknight.org/gtb/](https://vknight.org/gtb/)
- Content we will generate in class: through our discussions and activities we
  will generate valuable information. I will capture these.

## In class activities

In class we will not follow the class texts: these are there for you to read on
your own time. Instead we will use activities and other examples to illustrate
the concepts. I have my own notes for those (which are also available to you).

If you would like some information about the pedagogic approach:

- You can find my "teaching philosophy" here: [vknight.org/tch-phi/](https://vknight.org/tch-phi/)
- Here is a paper describing some of the pedagogic rational for this approach: [journals.gre.ac.uk/index.php/msor/article/view/254/254](https://journals.gre.ac.uk/index.php/msor/article/view/254/254)

It is possible that the course notes will change: **for things like typos and
clarifications**, all of the notes are hosted openly on github and if you're
interested you can find a list of all changes here:
[github.com/drvinceknight/gtb/commits/main](https://github.com/drvinceknight/gtb/commits/main)

## Technology in class

Please use whatever resources you need to be successful in this class. Let me
know if I can help with anything.

## Office hours

I will not hold specific office hours. Please speak to me (face to face or via
email) to arrange a time to meet.

## Kindness

In this course every participant (including myself) will be having many
interactions with other participants. Some potential examples of this:

- Peer to peer discussions during classes;
- Me explaining a given topic.

I expect **every participant** (including myself) to act with kindness
during these interactions.

Some examples of how this applies to me:

- When a student is late or absent at a class **I** will assume they
  have good reasons. If this happens regularly
  1.  I will first be concerned for their well-being.
  2.  Ask how **I** can help them catch up.
- If a student asks for an explanation of a topic that has been
  covered multiples times **I** will assume that some set of
  circumstances has prevented them from seeing these explanations and:
  1.  will explain the topic.
  2.  also point them at the explanations in the course materials
      and/or class recordings. If this is a regular occurrence I might
      ask if there are any circumstances that I can help with.
- If **I** make a mistake in a class explanation and someone helpfully
  points it out. **I** will listen and thank them for pointing it out
  and either go over the mistake then and there or go over it again at
  a future meeting.

## Assessment

There are three pieces of assessment in this course:

- Group research project (20%)
- Exam (80%)
