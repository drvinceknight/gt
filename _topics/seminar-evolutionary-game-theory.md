# Emergent Behavior in Complex Environments: Evolutionary Game Theory

## Abstract

Modelling macro behavior is an important goal of a lot of applied mathematical and
statistical fields. In Game Theory it is in fact the micro behavior that is modelled
so that the macro behavior can be observed. This is an important subject that extends
to applications not only in Mathematics but Economics, Biology, Ecology and Military Sciences.

In the second talk of this seminar series I will consider an extension to equilibrium behavior
based on mathematical notions of evolution. This area of game theory explores the idea not
of equilibrium but of actual emergence. Can we model mathematically if a given behavior can
actually emerge?

The answer to this is yes: it lies in the field of evolutionary game theory.
