# Emergent Behavior in Complex Environments: Cooperation

## Abstract

Modelling macro behavior is an important goal of a lot of applied mathematical and statistical fields.
In Game Theory it is in fact the micro behavior that is modelled so that the macro behavior can be observed.
This is an important subject that extends to applications not only in Mathematics but Economics, Biology,
Ecology and Military Sciences.

The first talk of this seminar series identified behaviors at which no actor has a reason to change their choice
of actions: Nash equilibrium. The second talk described a model to understand if such a an equilibrium can actually
emerge. Not all equilibrium that emerges is necessarily a social good, is it possible for cooperative behavior to emerge?

The answer to this is yes: this was first demonstrated by a series of computer tournaments held in the 1970s by Robert Axelrod.
