#### During the class

Invite two students to play 4 level centipede game:

- Player 1 can take or pass (if take: (2,0))
    - Player 2 can take or pass (if take: (1,3))
        - Player 1 can take or pass (if take: (4,2))
            - Player 2 can take or pass (if take (3,5))
                - Leaf: (4,4)

Give out chocolates based on what happened.

Now discuss notes:

- Connection
- Definitions of a strategy.

Two same players must now play but write down a recipe for what they would do in each case.

Play again: give out chocolates.

Write down Normal Form Game for whole thing.

S1 = {PP, PT, TP, TT}
S2 = {PP, PT, TP, TT}

Game is:

[4,4],[3,5],[1,3],[1,3]

[4,2],[4,2],[1,3],[1,3]

[2,0],[2,0],[2,0],[2,0]

[2,0],[2,0],[2,0],[2,0]

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & 3 & 1 & 1\\
4 & 4 & 1 & 1\\
2 & 2 & 2 & 2\\
2 & 2 & 2 & 2\\
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad

B = \begin{pmatrix}
4 & 5 & 3 & 3\\
2 & 2 & 3 & 3\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Have bottom right quadrant as NE (pairs of best responses).
